A. Sorting and HashMap: Sort each string inside the array alphabetically. For example, given the input ['cat', 'bat', 'tab'], after sorting each string, we get ['act', 'abt', 'abt']. Then, create a HashMap with the sorted string as the key. If the key doesn't exist, add it to the HashMap with the value being the index in the resultant array, where the original anagram group for this sorted string will be stored. In the result array, add a new empty array and append the corresponding original string of this new sorted string to it. If the sorted string is already in the HashMap, retrieve its value, which gives the index of the result array where this anagram group is stored, and simply append the corresponding original string to it. Time Complexity: O(n * k * log(k)), where n is the number of words and k is the maximum length of a word. The O(k * log(k)) complexity accounts for the sorting time of each string, while n represents the time spent iterating over the list. Space Complexity: O(n * k). In the worst case, all strings could be unique.

B. HashMap with Character Frequency: For each string, create an array of size 26, where each index corresponds to a character ('a' to 'z'). For each character in the string, increment the count at the corresponding index in the array by 1. For example, for the string "a", increment index 0 to 1, and for "aa", increment index 0 again by 1. Convert the frequency array into a string using a delimiter, and use it as the key in the HashMap. Store the original string in a list and use it as the value associated with that key. If another string has the same frequency key, simply append it to the list of strings at that key. Use a delimiter in the frequency string so that values don't overlap. For example, for 'bdddddddddd' and 'bbbbbbbbbbc', the frequency string is '010100000000000000000000000', which is the same for both. Adding a delimiter would separate the frequencies of each character and prevent this overlap. Time Complexity: O(n*k), where O(n) is for iterating over all n strings, and O(k) is the time taken to construct the frequency array for each string.. Space Complexity: O(n*k).
